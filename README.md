# Sudoku
This is a Windows GUI Sudoku game I developed back in *2012* using **C programming language**, *so forgive my 2012's code :D*

I published it in a forum called [http://arabteam2000-forum.com/](http://arabteam2000-forum.com/), here is the link to my post: [https://bit.ly/2z72wQy](https://bit.ly/2z72wQy)
